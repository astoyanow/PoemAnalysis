ONCE, deep in thought, I, passing ’neath some trees,
Beheld a troop of maidens gathering flowers;
One cried: “Ah look”; another: “Nay, see these,”
“What hast thou there?” “I doubt not lily-showers.”
“And here, I trow, are violets blue.”
A rose — woe’s me, a thorn hath pricked my finger through!”
“Alas, alas!”
What’s that in the grass?”
“A cricket.” “Make haste,
Here are salads to taste.”
“No, no!”
“But it’s so.”
97“Thee and thee I will show
Where the mushrooms do grow:
And this is the way
For the wild-thyme spray.”
“Come homewards, it darkeneth and soon it will rain,
It lightens, it thunders, hark! vespers again!”
“But it’s early still!”
“Lend an ear if you will.”
“The nightingale, I’ll be bound.”
“I hear a louder sound.”
“ ’Tis strange to me.”
“O what can it be?”
“Where, where?”
“Out there?”
“In the bushes.” Tic, toc.
Ever nearer the knock,
Till a snake crept out:
Then they turned about
In a wild affright:
“Ah me, sorry plight!”
“Alack aday!”
“Flee away!”
Then the rain poured down forlorn,
One slipped, another fell,
One trod upon a thorn,
Bossoms were spilled pell-mell,
Some cast aside, some left to lie,
Most fortunate who could swiftest fly:
And while I watched what they would do
The rain-shower drenched me through and through.
