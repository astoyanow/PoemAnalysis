I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and
 strong,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off
 work,
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand
 singing on the steamboat deck,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as
 he stands,
The woodcutter’s song, the plowboy’s on his way in the morning, or
 at noon intermission or at sundown,
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or
 of the girl sewing or washing,
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,
The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young
 fellows, robust, friendly,
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.
“I, Too, Sing America” by Langston Hughes (1925)
I, too, sing America.
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I’ll be at the table
When company comes.
Nobody’ll dare
Say to me,
“Eat in the kitchen,”
Then.
Besides,
They’ll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed—
I, too, am America.
