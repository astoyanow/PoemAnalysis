What light this is I may it know.
Its beams barred by finite time, though:
He should not mind me pausing now
To admire this light ere it go.
My wearied mind considers how
There is time enough to allow
Dead and dilated eyes to gaze
On light that’s not for me endowed.
It filters through in timid haze
For this room it’s not seen in days.
Dust dances where lighted day glows
In mute music and golden rays.
Sunlight is happy hope arose
But I have ássignments to close,
And pages to rove before I doze.
And pages to rove before I doze.
