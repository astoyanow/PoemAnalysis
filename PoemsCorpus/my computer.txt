My computer has a language
That is foreign to me
It speaks of RAM and Gigabytes
And what could ROM be!

I don't understand the Windows
My computer says are there
Nor the Gem Clip at the side of my page
Wth eyes that blink and stare!

I don't unerstand the cures
That maintenance wizards do
It's called defragmenter, span disk,
And virus cleaning too!

Yet, computer and I work hand and eye
With a mouse to translate
The tasks that I want it to do
While it points out my mistakes!
